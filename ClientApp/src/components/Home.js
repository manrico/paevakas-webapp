In 1895 connoisseur and confectioner Johann opened a café where no compromises were made. In the meeting place of Tartu’s educated
elite famous writers, poets, actors, musicians, artists and chess players have been gathering for over 115 years. People have sat, let time
fly by, shared ideas, drank coffee, treated themselves to some good food, done creative work and enjoyed an altogether enjoyable ambience.

The inspiring atmosphere has preserved throughout all these years.</p>
